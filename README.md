## Telegram Link Sanitizer 1.0

### Overview
I got tired of the stupid params that companies are putting in links. I wrote this scrappy script to take care of the issue on Telegram. It's not optimized and I don't care, it works.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pip
- pipreqs

You will want to use venv as well.
